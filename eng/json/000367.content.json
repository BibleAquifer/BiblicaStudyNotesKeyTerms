    "content": "<p>A rocky hilltop in Jerusalem. It was also called Mount Zion. It was north of the part of Jerusalem that David used for his government. In the Hebrew language Moriah means the place where the Lord provides and appears. It’s where God tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. Then God provided the ram to be sacrificed instead of Isaac. Many years later the angel of the Lord appeared on Mount Moriah. The angel brought a plague to destroy Jerusalem. God accepted the offering on the altar David built. David built that altar on a Jebusite’s threshing floor on Mount Moriah. Then God stopped the plague. That is why Solomon had the first temple built on Mount Moriah. The second temple was also built there.</p>",
