Jesus brought some people back to life again after they had died. Yet those people didn’t live for ever. They died again later on. That isn’t what happened to Jesus. In Jesus’ resurrection, God raised him from the dead to live for ever. He never died again. God will one day bring all people who have died back to life.</p>",
