    "content": "<p>Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word blood. The first meaning is the red liquid inside the bodies of humans and animals. The second meaning is a sign of life. Life is a gift from God. Blood was considered important because it showed that an animal or a person was alive. Losing blood was understood to lead to death. So anything that had to do with a loss of blood was considered unclean. Because blood was important, it was used to make things holy and clean. Sprinkling blood from sacrifices on someone or something was a sign. It showed that the person or object had been made clean from death and sin.</p>",
