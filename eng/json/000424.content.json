They were men from Aaron’s family line and served only the true God (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108343\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Levites</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108306\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Aaron</span>). They served him in the holy tent and later in the temple. They made sacrifices for the people to God. They followed special laws to be clean and pure. This allowed them to touch holy things. It also allowed them to be close to God in the holy tent or temple. People who weren’t priests weren’t allowed to do those things. God also said that all Israelites were priests. This didn’t mean that they all served him in the holy tent or temple. It meant that every Israelite could know God closely. Every Israelite could serve and worship him.</p>",
