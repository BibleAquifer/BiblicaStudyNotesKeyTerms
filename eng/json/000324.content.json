    "content": "<p>Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word light. The first meaning is when the sun is shining and there is light outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that agree with God. Light includes things that show or do what God wants for his world. It includes peace, understanding, health and goodness. God’s light works to free God’s world from evil and evil spiritual beings (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108218\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">evil spiritual beings</span>). These are described as darkness (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108039\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">darkness</span>). The time when God rules as King is talked about as the kingdom of light.</p>",
