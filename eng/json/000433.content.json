    "content": "<p>A male Jewish teacher. Rabbis usually studied the Old Testament and other Jewish writings in schools. They were usually trained by other rabbis. People who wanted to learn from them and be like them would become their disciples. Usually only boys and men were disciples or students. Jesus was a rabbi even though he wasnâ€™t trained like rabbis of his time. He welcomed both women and men as his students.</p>",
