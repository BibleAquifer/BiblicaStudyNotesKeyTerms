    "content": "<p>Sacrifices or offerings that God required his people to make when they sinned without meaning to. When people realised that they had sinned, they had to stop. They had to turn back to God and trust him to forgive them. They would show this by making a sin offering. Sacrificing an animal was a way to pay for the sin the person had done. The offering could be bulls, goats, lambs, doves, pigeons or fine flour. God required sin offerings to be made as soon as the sin was noticed. They were also to be made at a certain time of the year. Most sin offerings were eaten by priests inside the courtyard of the holy tent or temple. Other sin offerings were to be burnt completely. Parts of them were burnt on the altar. Other parts were burnt outside the camp or the city. When Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross, he paid for the sins of all people. He was the last sin offering needed.</p>",
