    "content": "<p>A sharp weapon used for fighting. Writers in the Bible said the words people speak are like swords. This showed how people can cause harm with their words. Writers in the Bible also said God’s word is like a sword. This showed that God’s word uncovers what is inside people’s hearts. It also showed that God’s word strengthens and protects believers when they struggle against evil. In a special way, the words from Jesus’ mouth were described as a sword. This was a picture of how Jesus is God’s word. Everything he speaks is the truth about God. Speaking truth about God is how he destroys the devil’s lies about God.</p>",
