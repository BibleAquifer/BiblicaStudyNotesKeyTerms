The one who buys back the thing or person is called the redeemer. God bought back the Israelites when they were slaves in Egypt. This showed that he was their redeemer. When Jesus died on the cross, he paid the price to buy back all sinners. He redeems all who trust in him. He redeems them from the power of sin, death and evil.</p>",
