    "content": "<p>Water was used in many practices to help the Israelites worship God. Priests washed their hands and feet with water when they served God at the altar. This water was held in a large bronze bowl. People and things that were considered unclean became clean after being washed in water. It was considered special when priests added ashes from a young cow to water. This special water was sprinkled on people or things after being near a dead body. Using water in these ways meant more than cleaning off dirt. It was a sign that people or things were considered spiritually clean and pure. Only people or things that were considered clean and pure could be close to God.</p>",
