    "content": "<p>A way that writers of the Bible described when something spiritually important happened. This could be a spiritual challenge. It could be a time of being close to God or meeting with God. It could be a time of turning away from sin and having stronger faith in God. It may or may not have lasted for a period of 40 days and 40 nights. The numbers were a sign about the spiritual thing that happened. This sign was important in the lives of many prophets and in the life of Jesus.</p>",
