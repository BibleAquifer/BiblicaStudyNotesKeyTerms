The work of human beings is to be rulers of God’s world (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108209\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">rulers</span>). This work is a blessing for people. It includes farming the land. It includes the many ways that people take care of what God has given them. God wants people to follow his example of working and resting. God doesn’t want people to be lazy. People must do their best to provide for themselves, their families and their communities.</p>",
