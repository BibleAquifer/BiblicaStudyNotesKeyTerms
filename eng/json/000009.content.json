    "content": "<p>The year that many important things recorded in the books of Jeremiah and Daniel happened. It was the year that Baruch wrote down Jeremiah’s prophecies. It was the year that there was an important battle between Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia. The battle was fought at a city on the Euphrates River called Carchemish. Babylonia’s armies won. The Babylonian government then had control over the nations in that area of the world. It was the year that Nebuchadnezzar became king of Babylon. It was also the year that Jehoiakim was taken as a prisoner to Babylon. He and a group of people from the southern kingdom were forced to leave Judah. They were forced to live in exile in Babylon. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in this group.</p>",
