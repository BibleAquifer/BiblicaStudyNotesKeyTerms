Ezekiel saw trees like the tree of life in his vision of the temple (Ezekiel 47:12). In Revelation, John saw this tree in the new heaven and the new earth (Revelation 22:2). Everyone who lived in God’s Holy City could eat of it freely. This meant that they had eternal life and lived for ever with God.</p>",
