The curtain was a sign of how human beings were separated from God. If people walked behind the curtain they would die. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Room. He did this once a year. When Jesus died, the curtain to the Most Holy Room ripped open. That was a sign that Jesus’ death brought people close to God again.</p>",

In the Hebrew language Moriah means the place where the Lord provides and appears. It’s where God tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. Then God provided the ram to be sacrificed instead of Isaac. Many years later the angel of the Lord appeared on Mount Moriah. The angel brought a plague to destroy Jerusalem. God accepted the offering on the altar David built. David built that altar on a Jebusite’s threshing floor on Mount Moriah. Then God stopped the plague. That is why Solomon had the first temple built on Mount Moriah. The second temple was also built there.</p>",

The people were to obey the Ten Commandments and the other laws that God gave Moses. God would give them health, safety, peace and many children while they lived in Canaan. He would give them enough to eat and drink. He would make them a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Circumcision and the Sabbath day were the signs of the covenant.

God’s covenant with Noah and the Ten Commandments made this clear. Murder was described as spilling someone’s blood on the ground. That blood made the ground impure. It cried out to God. This meant that the blood was a witness against the murderer. It showed that justice needed to be done. The murderer had to be put to death. That brought justice back to the people and to the land. In the New Testament, Jesus taught that murder meant more than killing someone. Hating someone was as serious a sin as committing murder.</p>",

They didn’t know exactly who would be saved. Paul explained this mystery in his letters. God’s plan was to save all people who trust in Jesus. Jesus is a human being and is God’s Son. God saves his people from the power of sin, evil and death. He saves them through what Jesus did when he sacrificed himself on the cross.</p>",
