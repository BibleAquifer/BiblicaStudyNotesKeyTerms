    "content": "<p>The message about Jesus. In the Greek language the entire message is called the gospel. (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"108031\" data-resourceType=\"BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms\">Gospel</span>) It’s the message that God rescues people from the power of sin and death. This means that people can fully worship their Creator. They can live in peace with him and with others. This can happen because Jesus gave his life to save all human beings. He died as a sacrifice to free people from being slaves to evil. Then God raised Jesus from the dead. Jesus is the Jewish Messiah that God had promised to send. He brings God’s eternal life and the power of resurrection to all who believe him.</p>",
