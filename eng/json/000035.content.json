This was a way of saying that he is the first and the last. He was at the beginning when God created all things. He will be at the end of the world as it is now. It’s a way of saying that Jesus has always existed and will always exist. It’s also a way of saying that Jesus is God. God the Father called himself the Alpha and the Omega in Revelation 21:6.</p>",
