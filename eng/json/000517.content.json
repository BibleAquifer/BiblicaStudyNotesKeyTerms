    "content": "<p>The building in Jerusalem where people could go to worship God. It was also called the house of the Lord or the house of God. The first one was built when Solomon was king. God was present with his people there. The Babylonians destroyed it in the year 586 BC. Many years later, the Jews built another one. After the Romans destroyed that temple in the year AD 70, the Jews never built another one. Jesus called the temple his Fatherâ€™s house. Jesus said his body was the new temple. This was because God was present with his people through Jesus. God remains present on earth through those who follow Jesus. They are filled with the Holy Spirit. Because of this, believers are described as a new temple.</p>",
