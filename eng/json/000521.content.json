    "content": "<p>The Israelites were to offer a tenth of everything they had to God. This included everything their land produced and their livestock. This would help them remember that everything belongs to God. It would help them remember that everything they had was a gift from God. It would help them be full of joy in the land God gave them. They gave the tenth of everything to God by sharing it with the priests and Levites. They also shared it with poor and needy people. The practice of giving God a tenth of everything lasted for hundreds of years. Itâ€™s also called giving a tithe. Many Christians give a tithe to their church. The tithe can be of anything their work produces including money.</p>",
