God made Adam from dust and breathed life into him. He had friendship and peace with God while he lived in the Garden of Eden. He worked together with Eve to take care of the garden. He named all the creatures God made. Adam was the father of Cain, Abel and Seth. When Adam and Eve stopped obeying God, they had to leave the Garden of Eden.</p>",
