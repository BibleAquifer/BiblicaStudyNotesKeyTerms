They are the riches in heaven that Jesus talked about (Matthew 6:19–21). There are many kinds of spiritual blessings. Wisdom, understanding, grace, hope and love are spiritual blessings. Being forgiven for sin and having eternal life are also spiritual blessings. People don’t earn spiritual blessings. God gives them freely.</p>",
