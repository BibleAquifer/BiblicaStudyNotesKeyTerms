Then he brought judgement against them to stop their evil deeds. His judgement was that he would no longer allow them to stay in their land. He would use the Israelites as his tool to drive them out. But the Israelites didn’t obey God completely. They didn’t drive out all the Canaanites. Instead, the Israelites lived with the Canaanites and followed their evil ways.</p>",
