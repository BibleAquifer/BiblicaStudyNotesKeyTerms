Then he preached to Gentiles. He helped start churches among those who believed in Jesus. He travelled with Barnabas on the first journey. He travelled with Silas on the second journey. He travelled with several helpers on the third journey. He travelled as a prisoner to Rome on his fourth journey. Each journey lasted more than a year.</p>",
