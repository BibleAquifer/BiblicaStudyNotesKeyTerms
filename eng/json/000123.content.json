The covenant was also with all the creatures that were in the ark. It was with all life on earth. Human beings and animals were to fill the earth. No human beings were to be killed. God promised to never again curse the ground. He promised to never again destroy all life on earth by a flood. The rainbow was the sign of the covenant.</p>",
