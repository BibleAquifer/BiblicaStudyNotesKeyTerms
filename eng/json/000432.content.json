Things are considered impure when they go against what God wants. People’s thoughts, words and actions can be pure or impure. The Bible also calls pure things clean and impure things unclean. The Holy Spirit lives among people who live in pure ways. People who live in impure ways can’t be near to God. In the Old Testament, God gave his people ways to be considered pure and clean. When Jesus came, his sacrifice on the cross made his followers pure. Jesus’ followers remain pure by following Jesus’ example for living.
