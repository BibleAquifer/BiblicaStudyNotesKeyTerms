    "content": "<p>God shows himself to be the Spirit at the creation of the world. The Holy Spirit is God just like the Father is God and Jesus is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. The Holy Spirit worked through the people who recorded the books of the Bible. In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit made it possible for people to prophesy. The Spirit also made it possible for people to do skilful work and mighty deeds. In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit made it possible for Mary to be Jesus’ mother. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to his followers at the Feast of Pentecost. Through the Holy Spirit, believers are joined to Jesus. The Holy Spirit is a Friend who makes Jesus’ followers able to continue doing his work.</p>",
