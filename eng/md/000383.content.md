## New covenant (id: 132499)

The set of promises God made to his people for when they returned from exile. It would last for ever. God would make his people able to follow him faithfully. He would do this by forgiving their sin and their evil ways. God first announced the new covenant through the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Many years later Jesus announced it. Jesus gave up his life as a sacrifice to save people from sin and death. Then he was raised from the dead. This put the new covenant into effect. In the new covenant, all who trust Jesus to save them are part of Godâ€™s people. They are made right with God. The Holy Spirit makes them able to follow Jesus and to obey God faithfully.
