## Joash (id: 132437)

The son of Ahaziah and Zibia. He was the father of Amaziah and was from the tribe of Judah. He was the seventh king of the southern kingdom. His grandmother Athaliah tried to murder him but his aunt Jehosheba saved him. Joash grew up in the temple with Jehoiada. He became king when he was seven years old. He made sure that the temple was repaired. He followed God faithfully and led the people to worship only God. He did this for as long as Jehoiada was alive. After Jehoiada died, Joash did evil things and worshipped false gods.
