## Groups of sevens (id: 132131)

In John’s visions, he saw God’s judgement happen in groups of seven things. There were seven seals, seven trumpets and seven bowls. At the end of each group there was lightning, thunder and an earthquake. In the Bible, seven is the number for things being complete.
