## Jealous (id: 132291)

One way that God describes himself. He isnâ€™t jealous in the sinful way that human beings can be jealous. Human beings can be jealous of others who have something they themselves need or want. God is jealous when human beings worship false gods. This is because he is the only true God. He is the only one worthy of being worshipped.
