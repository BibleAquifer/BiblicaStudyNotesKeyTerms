## Heart (id: 132365)

Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word heart. The first meaning is the part of the body that beats inside the chest. The second meaning is a spiritual part of people where they feel their feelings. It’s where they make decisions about what to do and who to worship. God knows each person’s heart. He knows what they think and feel and the reasons why they make their decisions. God’s people are to serve God with all their heart. This means that they are to be completely committed to living according to God’s ways.
