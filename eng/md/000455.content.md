## Sadducees (id: 132004)

The group of Jewish religious leaders with the most authority in Jerusalem. This was during the times of the New Testament. They were in charge of the temple and worked closely with the Roman rulers. They didn’t believe in angels or that God raised people from the dead. They didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah God had promised to send. Most Sadducees opposed Jesus and his teachings.
