## Red Sea (id: 132266)

A large body of water at the border of Egypt during the time of the exodus. It isnâ€™t known for sure which body of water this is today. God divided the water so the people of Israel could walk through on dry ground. After the Israelites reached the other side, the Egyptians drowned in the water.
