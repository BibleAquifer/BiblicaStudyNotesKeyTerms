## Exodus (id: 132262)

When God used Moses to rescue the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. In the Greek language the word exodus means to exit or to leave. The exodus was the time when God showed himself to be the Saviour of Israel. He did mighty works and brought judgement against Pharaoh, Egypt and Egypt’s false gods. The exodus is a picture of the salvation that God offers to all human beings. The death of the lambs is a picture of Jesus’s death many years later. Jesus was sacrificed as the Lamb of God. The blood of the lambs was put on the doors to save the Israelites. This is a picture of how Jesus’ blood saves those who believe in him. The Israelites were freed from slavery. This is a picture of how God frees those who trust in him. He frees them from slavery to the power of sin, death and evil.
