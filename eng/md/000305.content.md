A leader who made decisions about laws. Each community in Israel had local judges. There were also judges at the holy tent and the temple. They made decisions about cases that were too hard for local judges. Levites helped judges make their decisions. Kings in Israel also served as judges by making decisions about cases. Judges were always to do what was right and fair. The people were to respect them and obey their decisions.
