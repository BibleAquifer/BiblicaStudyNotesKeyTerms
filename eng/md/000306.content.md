## Judgement (id: 132179)

Suffering and punishment for doing what goes against what God wants. God brings judgement against people, people groups and evil spiritual beings. He brings judgement to stop sinful things and evil deeds. Judgement against evil is how God brings justice back to his world. Judgement from God can feel painful and can lead to people dying. It can also lead people to repent and to turn away from sin and evil. It can teach people to do what God wants done. This allows people to live in peace with God and with one another.
