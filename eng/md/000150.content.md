## Dreams (id: 132219)

One way that God makes himself and his plans known to people. Sometimes God’s message through a dream is very clear to people. Other times it may not be clear to them. God gives some people the ability to understand other people’s dreams. They help others understand the message from God. Not all dreams are messages from God. People don’t make dreams from God happen. They are a gift from God.
