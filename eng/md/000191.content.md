## Feast of Trumpets (id: 132322)

The first day of the seventh month. Rams’ horns were blown like trumpets. It was nine days before the day when sins were paid for. The Israelites used those days to rest and to think about and admit their sins. They used them to get ready for the Day of Atonement. This feast is now called Rosh Hashanah. It’s now considered the first day of the new year for Jews.
