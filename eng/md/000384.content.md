## New creation (id: 132489)

The world when God makes all things new. It’s called the new heaven and the new earth. It’s also called the world to come. It includes everything that God created. The new creation will come when God has fully won the battle over evil. Jesus will rule completely as King. He will raise his followers from the dead and give them new bodies. They will enjoy eternal life with God for ever. Jesus’ body after his resurrection was the first sign of the new creation.
