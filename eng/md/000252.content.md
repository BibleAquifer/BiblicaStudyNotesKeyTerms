## Holy (id: 132307)

Being set apart. God is holy. This means that he is different from everything else that exists. In the Bible certain places were holy. This was because people were aware that God was present there. Certain things were holy. This meant that they were used in special ways to worship God. The opposite of holy is unholy or evil. Things that are unholy can’t be in God’s presence.
