## 40 years (id: 132338)

A way that writers of the Bible described something that happened for a long time. 40 years was thought to equal how long it took to grow old. It described how long the Israelites wandered in the desert before entering Canaan. It described how long many important leaders and kings ruled in Israel. The number was a sign that what happened was important.
