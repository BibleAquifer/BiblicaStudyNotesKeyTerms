## Covenant with David (id: 132412)

God chose to work through David and his family in his plan to save the world. God showed this by making a covenant with David and the sons born after him. God promised to make David’s rule secure and to give the Israelites peace and rest. God promised that sons from David’s family line would rule as kings in Israel. David and his sons after him were to be faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. If they were faithful, God wouldn’t take the kingdom away from David’s family line. They would always be kings over the Israelites. God also promised something else in this covenant. A son from David’s family line would rule for ever over God’s kingdom. This promise didn’t depend on anything David and the sons after him did. It didn’t depend on them being faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. Old Testament writers understood that this was a promise about the Messiah. New Testament writers understood that this promise was fulfilled in Jesus. (David)
