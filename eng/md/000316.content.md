## Last days (id: 132482)

A way to talk about a time in the future. Some prophets in the Bible described it as a time when God would take action. He would take action to make sure that all people honoured him. Other writers in the Bible described it as a time of suffering. It would be a time before God judged the world. People would do many evil things during that time. Some New Testament writers described the time after Jesus’ resurrection as the last days. It was considered the time the church lives in until Jesus returns to earth.
