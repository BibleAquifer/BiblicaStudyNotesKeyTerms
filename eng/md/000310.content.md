## Kingdom of God (id: 132507)

God’s rule as King over all that he created. This includes heaven and earth. The kingdom of God is also called the kingdom of heaven. One day everyone will recognise that God has complete authority and all power. Everyone and everything will serve and worship only God. Life for everything God created will be the way God always wanted it to be. Jesus announced the message about God’s kingdom. He taught about it through parables. It comes to earth in a slow process. It started through Jesus’ work. It keeps spreading as the church continues to be faithful to Jesus. (Heaven)
