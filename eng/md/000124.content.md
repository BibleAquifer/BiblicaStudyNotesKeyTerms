## Creation (id: 132143)

Everything that exists was made by God. This includes the land, the seas, the sky and everything in them. It also includes everything in the heavenly world. All that God created was good when he made it. Creation suffers because of the sins of human beings. God will set it free from the effects of sin in the new creation. (New creation).
