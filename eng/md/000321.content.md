## Letters to the churches (id: 132119)

Jesus commanded John to write letters with messages to seven churches. Each letter began by describing Jesus in a different way. In most of the letters, Jesus mentioned ways that the church was living faithfully. In most he also mentioned ways the church wasnâ€™t being faithful to him. Jesus urged the believers in each church to listen to the Holy Spirit. Jesus finished each letter with a promise. The promise was for those who shared in his victory over the power of sin.
