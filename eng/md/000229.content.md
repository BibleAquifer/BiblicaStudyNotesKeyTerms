## Greece (id: 132140)

A kingdom that was very powerful in the years between the Old and New Testaments. Greek rulers controlled Israel and Jerusalem for a time. Then Roman armies took control of the lands ruled by the Greeks. But Greek ways of thinking and acting lasted even during Roman rule. The Greek language was spoken by people in areas all around the Mediterranean Sea. The New Testament was written in Greek.
