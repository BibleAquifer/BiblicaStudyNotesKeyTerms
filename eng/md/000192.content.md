## Feast of Unleavened Bread (id: 132319)

The Jewish feast that lasted for seven days after Passover. During this time the bread that the Israelites ate didn’t have yeast in it. This was to remind them of the exodus. When God freed them from slavery, they left Egypt quickly. They didn’t have time to use yeast in their bread. Israelite males were required to travel to the holy tent or temple for this feast.
