## Epicureans (id: 132078)

A group of thinkers who followed the teachings of the Greek thinker Epicurus. They believed that the goal of life was to have complete peace. They could have complete peace when they had everything they really needed. Then they wouldnâ€™t worry about anything. They also believed that there was no life after death. Paul shared the good news about Jesus with Epicureans in Athens.
