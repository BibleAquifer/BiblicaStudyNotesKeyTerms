## Good works (id: 132006)

Things that people do that please God. Believers don’t do good works in order to earn God’s love and grace. They do them because of God’s love and grace in their lives. The Holy Spirit gives believers the strength to do good works. When people follow Jesus’ example of thinking, speaking and acting, they are doing good works. Good works include taking care of God’s creation and serving others. Good works bring blessing to others and praise to God.
