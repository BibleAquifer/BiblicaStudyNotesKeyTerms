## Meribah (id: 132340)

In the Hebrew language, the word Meribah means to argue. There are two places called Meribah in the Bible. At both places the Israelites argued with God and Moses because they didn’t have water. One place was called Massah and Meribah. The other place was called Meribah Kadesh and was near Kadesh Barnea.
