## Atone (id: 132313)

To bring peace back to something when the peace has been destroyed. In relationships, peace is destroyed when people sin against one another. This also destroys the peace between the sinner and God. The person who sins must repent and stop doing what they have done wrong. And the sin must be paid for. This allows for there to be peace again between people. It also allows for there to be peace between people and God. (Day of Atonement)
