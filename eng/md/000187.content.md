## Father (id: 132258)

One name for God. The Father is God just like Jesus is God and the Holy Spirit is God. They are the three persons of the one and only God. God showed himself to be Israel’s Father during the exodus and called Israel his son. Later, God showed himself to be the Father of Jesus. Jesus shows that God is the Father of all who are part of God’s family.
