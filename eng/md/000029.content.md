## Adonijah (id: 132420)

The son of David and Haggith. He made himself king before David appointed Solomon as king. When Solomon became king, Solomon spared Adonijahâ€™s life. Then Adonijah made a foolish request. He tried to have more authority than Solomon and tried to become king. Solomon had him killed for that.
