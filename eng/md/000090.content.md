## Body of Christ (id: 132089)

A way of describing the community of Jesus’ followers. It’s a picture that describes how everyone in the church loves and serves one another. Christ’s body is made up of many different people who are brought together as one. Trusting in Jesus and obeying him is what makes them one. Using their different gifts, together they continue doing Jesus’ work on earth.
