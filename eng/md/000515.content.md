## Teach their children (id: 132264)

Israelite children were encouraged to ask questions about God and about worship practices. Parents were to explain to their children why they worshipped God in certain ways. This way the children would learn about who God is. They would learn about the mighty works that God does in the world. This was important because God had promised to be their God for ever. He wanted everyone in Jacobâ€™s family line to know him.
