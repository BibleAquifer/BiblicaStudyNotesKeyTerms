## Clean or unclean (id: 132309)

The way the Law of Moses described things that could or couldnʼt be near God. These words have a spiritual meaning. They donʼt mean that something is dirty or not dirty. In the Bible, clean things were pure and unclean things were impure. This means that people who were clean could be fully part of Godʼs people. Unclean people had to stay separate and couldnʼt worship God together with others. (Pure or impure Leviticus 11:1–15:33\.)
