## 24 elders (id: 132127)

Beings that John saw in a vision of heaven. It’s thought that they are a sign. The number 24 may mean the 12 tribes of Israel together with the 12 apostles. In this way they are a sign for all of God’s people. Their white clothes show that they have been made right with God. Their crowns and thrones show that they are part of the kingdom of God. These also show that the elders have authority to rule. The elders worship God for creating the world and for saving his people. They worship him for being holy, great and worthy.
