## 12 tribes (id: 132232)

Jacob had 12 sons. The families of Jacob’s sons and grandsons became very large tribes. These 12 family groups made up the nation of Israel. In different parts of the Bible, the list of tribes includes different names. But they are all sons or grandsons of Jacob. God promised to give them the land of Canaan to live in. (Jacob)
