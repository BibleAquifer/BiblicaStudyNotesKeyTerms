## Korah (id: 132339)

A man born a Hebrew slave in Egypt. He was from the tribe of Levi but wasn’t from Aaron’s family line. In the desert, he led many people to oppose Moses and Aaron. God destroyed him and those who followed him. Later, some of the people from his family line served God faithfully. This included the prophet Samuel and men known as the sons of Korah. They led Israel in worshipping God with psalms.
