## Balaam (id: 132344)

A prophet from Mesopotamia who wasn’t from Jacob’s family line. He used magic to learn what would happen in the future. Balak hired him to put a curse on the people of Israel. Balaam’s donkey spoke to him to try to stop him. God caused Balaam to bless his people instead of cursing them.
