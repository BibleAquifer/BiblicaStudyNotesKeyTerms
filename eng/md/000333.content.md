## Love God (id: 132301)

God created people to receive his love and to love him in return. Godâ€™s love changes people and makes them able to love him. Love for God is both a feeling and a choice that people act on. The action they take is to obey him. Love for God is shown by obeying his commandments. The Law of Moses in the Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament teach this.
