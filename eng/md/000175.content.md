## Evil spiritual beings (id: 132164)

Spiritual beings that God created but that turned against him. These include demons, evil spirits and angels who don’t serve God. Evil spiritual beings work against God. The devil is their leader. They can use their power to control people and to be inside of them. Humans can worship and serve evil spiritual beings instead of God. When humans do this, they become slaves to the power of sin and death. Jesus drove out evil spiritual beings from many people. They can’t be inside of or control people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Holy Spirit gives Jesus’ followers power to drive evil spiritual beings out like Jesus did. (Devil)
