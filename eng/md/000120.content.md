## Covenant curses (id: 132326)

Terrible things that happened when people weren’t faithful to a covenant. In covenants with God, not being faithful meant not living according to God’s ways. This stopped the covenant blessings and led to people suffering in many ways. The suffering usually had to do with losing the land God had given them. It had to do with their children dying. And it had to do with God’s presence leaving them.
