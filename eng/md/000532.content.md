## Tree of the knowledge (id: 132156)

This was the tree of the knowledge of good and of evil. It was in the middle of the Garden of Eden. It was the only tree that Adam and Eve weren’t allowed to eat from. This is because only God knows and decides what is good and what is evil. Human beings aren’t allowed to decide about that.
