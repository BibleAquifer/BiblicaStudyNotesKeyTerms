## Spiritual armour (id: 132103)

Tools that God gives his people to protect them from evil. These tools can’t be held in people’s hands. They are spiritual. They are described as armour or weapons because believers use them in spiritual fights. Truth, godliness, peace, faith, salvation, God’s word and prayer are kinds of spiritual armour. These tools help believers to be strong in their faith. They help them to follow Jesus faithfully and to say no to evil.
