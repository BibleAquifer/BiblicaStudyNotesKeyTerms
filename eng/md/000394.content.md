## Olive tree (id: 132088)

A common tree in the area around the Mediterranean Sea. Olive trees and their fruit provide food, oil, medicine and wood. Writers of the Bible used the olive tree as a sign to explain other things. The leaves were a sign of peace. The oil was used to anoint objects or people and set them apart as holy. The oil was also a sign for God’s Spirit. The oil is made by crushing the olives. This is a picture of Jesus’ suffering on the Mount of Olives before he died. Olive trees are also a picture of the people of God.
