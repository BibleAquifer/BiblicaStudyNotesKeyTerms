## Siloam (id: 132030)

A place inside the walls of Jerusalem where there was a pool of fresh water. Siloam means sent. The first pool there was built by King Hezekiah. The Babylonians destroyed it but it was rebuilt in Nehemiah’s time. Water from the pool was poured on the altar during the Feast of Booths. The pool’s water came from the Gihon spring. There was also a tower there that fell during Jesus’ time and killed 18 people.
