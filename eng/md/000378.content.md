## Nazirites (id: 132330)

Men and women who wanted to set themselves apart to serve God. In the Hebrew language the word nazir means to be separated or set apart. God commanded some Israelites to be set apart for serving him. Others chose to do this and were called Nazirites. They promised to serve God for a certain amount of time. They were to avoid alcohol and to let their hair grow long. They were to stay away from anything or anyone that had died. These were signs to other Israelites that Nazirites were completely committed to God. At the end of their time of being set apart they celebrated. They did this by shaving their head and offering sacrifices.
