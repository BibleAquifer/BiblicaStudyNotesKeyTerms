## Three men (id: 132206)

Three men with human bodies visited Abraham. They ate a meal that Abraham and Sarah prepared. They told Abraham and Sarah that Isaac would be born within a year. They talked with Abraham about God’s plans to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Two of these men were angels. They continued travelling to Sodom and Gomorrah to destroy the cities and to save Lot. The other man was God. God is a spiritual being. He can appear to human beings. He can appear in a way that they see him and recognise who he is.
