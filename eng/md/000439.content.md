## Repent (id: 132292)

To turn away from sin and turn towards God. This isn’t done only one time in someone’s life. Every time someone sins, God wants them to turn towards him. God has grace and forgives them. This heals their relationship with God. For many years the Israelites offered sacrifices to show that they had repented. In the New Testament, people showed that they repented by asking for forgiveness, trusting in Jesus and following him. (Right with God)
