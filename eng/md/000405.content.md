## Peace (id: 132157)

The word for peace in the Hebrew language is shalom. It means more than a time when there is no fighting or war. It means that there is safety, health and justice. It means that everyone has enough of what they need. It means that relationships are whole and healthy. They are the way God wants them to be. This includes each person being at peace with God. It also includes the relationships between people and everything else that God created.
