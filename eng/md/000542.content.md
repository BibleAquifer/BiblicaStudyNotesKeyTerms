## Wives (id: 132223)

In Old Testament times and places many men had more than one wife. Many stories in the Bible show the problems that this caused for families. It caused problems in Jacob’s family. It also caused problems for leaders and kings like Solomon. Over time, the Israelites came to understand that a man should only have one wife. This was the practice for Jesus’ followers in the New Testament. (Marriage)
