## Sarah (id: 132193)

A woman from Mesopotamia who was Abraham’s wife. She was the daughter of Terah but from a different mother than Abraham. God changed Sarai’s name to Sarah in Genesis chapter 17\. In the Hebrew language, Sarai and Sarah both mean princess or noble woman. For many years she was unable to have children. God promised that she would have a son. When she was very old, she gave birth to Isaac.
