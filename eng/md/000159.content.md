## Eli (id: 132397)

The high priest when Samuel was young during the time of the 12 judges. He served while the holy tent was in Shiloh. Eli was the father of Hophni and Phinehas. He didn’t stop his sons from doing evil things. Because of this, Eli’s family line didn’t continue to serve as high priests.
