## Docetism (id: 132113)

A belief that Jesus didn’t have a human body and wasn’t fully a human being. It was based on a Greek idea. This idea was that bodies were evil. This idea was also that only spiritual things that last for ever were good. Docetism became part of a way of thinking called Gnosticism. Gnosticism explained that the world had problems because people had bodies. Gnostics believed that human beings were saved by having secret knowledge.
