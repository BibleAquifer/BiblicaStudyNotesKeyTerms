## Laws in Leviticus (id: 132308)

God gave Moses and Aaron laws for how the Israelites were to live together. Many of them were general rules about things that might have happened in those days. They were to help the people learn about who God is. The laws helped them to make wise decisions about everyday matters. Godâ€™s people were to make all their decisions based on who God is.
