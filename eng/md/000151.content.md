## Dressed in white (id: 132125)

A way of describing when people are obeying God. In the Bible, the colour white is a sign of things that are considered pure. People are pure when they do what God wants done. White clothing is a sign of doing that. In Revelation, people’s clothes become white by being washed in the Lamb’s blood. This means that people trust in Jesus to save them from the power of sin.
