## Outsider (id: 132315)

Anyone who doesn’t belong to a place or a group. People who lived somewhere different than where their family was from were considered outsiders. People who became part of a group that wasn’t part of their family group were also considered outsiders. The Israelites considered anyone who wasn’t part of Jacob’s family line to be an outsider. Outsiders who lived with them had to obey certain laws from the Law of Moses. Israelites who didn’t faithfully follow the Law of Moses were often treated as outsiders. They were also called sinners. Israelites who were considered unclean according to the Law of Moses were treated like outsiders. Most outsiders couldn’t be fully part of their community. But some like Ruth were fully accepted as members of the Israelite community. Some outsiders were also known as strangers and foreigners.
