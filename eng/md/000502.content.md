## Stephen (id: 132047)

One of the seven leaders chosen by the believers in Jerusalem to be a deacon. He made sure all the believers had enough food. Many Jews were angry that he preached about Jesus. They killed him by throwing stones at him. He was the first of Jesusâ€™ followers to be killed for being faithful to Jesus.
