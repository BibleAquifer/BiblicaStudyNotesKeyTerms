## 1,000 years (id: 132135)

In a vision, John saw that the devil was locked in the Abyss for 1,000 years. John also saw that Christ ruled for 1,000 years. Some of his followers who had been put to death ruled with him. Some people believe that these things will happen exactly as John saw them in the vision. Others believe that these things are signs. They are signs of how God will bring judgement against evil and bring his kingdom to earth.
