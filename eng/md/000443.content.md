## Right with God (id: 132200)

Being able to live in peace and joy with God. This is also called being made righteous or being justified. It means that people can enjoy the blessings of God’s covenant. It also means that people can be freed from the power of sin, death and evil. God frees them through Jesus’ death and resurrection. People who trust in God and have faith in him are made right with him.
