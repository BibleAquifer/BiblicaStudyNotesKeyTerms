## Passover Feast (id: 132263)

The time when Jews celebrate how God saved them from being slaves in Egypt. It’s the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The name Passover comes from something that happened right before the exodus. God passed over the houses of the Israelites during the tenth plague. That is why their eldest sons weren’t killed during that plague. After that plague Pharaoh let the Israelites leave Egypt. God gave the Israelites instructions about how to celebrate Passover every year. It included a special meal with certain foods. Many years later, Jesus was killed at the time of Passover.
