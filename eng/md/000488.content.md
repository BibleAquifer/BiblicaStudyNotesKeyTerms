## Solomon (id: 132419)

The son of David and Bathsheba who became king of Israel. God gave him the name Jedidiah. In the Hebrew language Jedidiah means loved by the Lord. This name showed that God had chosen Solomon to be king after David. Solomon was the king when the temple was built in Jerusalem. He was very wise and very rich. He wrote many proverbs and songs. Later in his rule Solomon stopped being faithful to God. This led to the nation of Israel separating into two kingdoms.
