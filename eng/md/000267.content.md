The name that God gave Jacob. In the Hebrew language Israel means someone who struggles or wrestles with God. All people from Jacob’s family line were called the people of Israel. They are known as Israelites. God made the Mount Sinai covenant with them (Mount Sinai covenant). He chose them to show all other people groups who he is. Israel also was the name of the land where Jacob’s family line lived after the exodus. After King Solomon died, the northern kingdom was called Israel.
