## Timothy (id: 132070)

A young man from Lystra who worked with Paul. His father was a Greek Gentile. Because his mother was a Jew, Timothy was considered a Jew. His grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice were believers. Paul trusted Timothy and loved him like a son. Timothy served in many of the churches Paul helped start. He was with Paul when the apostle wrote many of his letters. The New Testament includes two letters Paul wrote to Timothy.
