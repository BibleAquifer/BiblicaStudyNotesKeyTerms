## Messages of judgement (id: 132480)

Messages God sent to people through a prophet about judgement that he would bring. The messages warned the people to stop doing evil things. God warned them to turn away from their sin and to repent. God warned them because he wanted them to change their ways. If they didn’t change, God would bring judgement against them. If they did change, God wouldn’t bring judgement against them. Giving people these warnings showed that God was full of mercy.
