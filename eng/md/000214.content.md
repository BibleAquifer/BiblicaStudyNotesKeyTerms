The Creator of everything that exists. In the Bible God is called Lord (Lord). He is also called Lord (Lord). God is love and is the only true God. God does what is right. God is full of grace. God is a spiritual being. In the Bible God is often described as if he were like human beings. The Bible talks about God’s face, eyes, back, hands, arms, fingers and other parts. It talks about God’s mind and heart and God’s feelings. These ways of describing God don’t mean that he has a body like humans do. They are signs and pictures to help humans understand something about who God is and his actions.
