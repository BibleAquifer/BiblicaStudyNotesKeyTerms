## Believer (id: 132023)

Someone who believes in Jesus Christ and follows him. In the New Testament they are also called Christians. They believe that Jesus of Nazareth is God’s Son who rose from the dead. Believers worship Jesus as God. They serve him as Messiah and King. Believers were first called Christians at Antioch in Syria. They are called by Christ’s name because they follow his way of life. Believers remain part of their community and their people group as they follow Jesus. They continue their people group’s laws and practices. They do this unless the laws and practices go against what Jesus taught. This is true for Jewish believers and for Gentile believers.
