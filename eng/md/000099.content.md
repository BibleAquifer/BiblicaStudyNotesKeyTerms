## Cain (id: 132168)

The eldest son of Adam and Eve. He was a farmer. He made an offering that didnâ€™t please God. He killed his brother Abel. The ground where he murdered Abel was a witness against him. God brought justice by punishing Cain. He could no longer live in only one place or be a farmer. God protected Cain from being killed by other people.
