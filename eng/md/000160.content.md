## Elijah (id: 132432)

A prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel when Ahab and Ahaziah ruled. He was from the land of Gilead. He was known to wear clothes made from hair and a leather belt. His words and actions challenged the authority of rulers in Israel who worshipped false gods. He taught many other prophets. He gave his authority to Elisha to be a prophet after him. Elijah was like Moses in many ways. God performed miracles through him and appeared to him on Mount Horeb. Elijah didn’t die but was taken up to heaven in a strong wind. No one ever found his body.
