## Elijah (id: 132432)

A prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel when Ahab and Ahaziah ruled. He was from the land of Gilead. He was known to wear clothes made from hair and a leather belt. His words and actions challenged the authority of rulers in Israel who worshipped false gods. He taught many other prophets. He gave his authority to Elisha to be a prophet after him. Elijah was like Moses in many ways. God performed miracles through him and appeared to him on Mount Horeb. Elijah didnâ€™t die but was taken up to heaven in a strong wind. No one ever found his body.
