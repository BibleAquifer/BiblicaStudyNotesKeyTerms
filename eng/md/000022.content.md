## Abyss (id: 132132)

A way of talking about a place full of evil spiritual beings. In Luke’s gospel, Jesus had authority to send evil spiritual beings there (Luke 8:31\). In a vision recorded in Revelation, John saw it as a bottomless pit. It was ruled over by an evil spiritual being called the Destroyer. Evil spiritual beings came out of it only when God allowed them to. (Evil spiritual beings)
