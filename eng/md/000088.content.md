## Bless all nations (id: 132191)

God promised that all nations on earth would be blessed through Abraham and his family line. God repeated this promise to Isaac and to Jacob. It was repeated in Psalm 72 and Zechariah chapter 8\. This promise was fulfilled in many ways. One way was through the laws of God’s covenant with the Israelites. The Israelites were to worship God only and obey the Mount Sinai covenant. This would show other nations how wise and understanding God’s people were. It would show other nations that God was near to his people and loved them. This would make other nations want to worship and obey the true God. Another way was through Jesus. Jesus was from Abraham’s family line. All people on earth can be made right with God by believing in Jesus. That is how God’s promise about all nations being blessed is completely fulfilled.
