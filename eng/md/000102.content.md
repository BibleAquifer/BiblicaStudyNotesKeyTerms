## Canaan (id: 132192)

An area of land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. In the south it reached almost to the Desert of Sinai. In the north it reached to River Euphrates. The people groups living there before the Israelites were called Canaanites. Many of these groups were from the family line of Ham’s son Canaan. This included the Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites and Amorites. Some Canaanites recognised that God is the true God. Some of them were helpful to God’s people and became part of them. Others refused to worship only God. They were enemies of the people of Israel and God brought judgement against them. Canaan was where the areas now called Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and parts of Syria are. God promised this area to Abraham’s family line. The tribes of Israel lived there after being freed from slavery in Egypt.
