## Neighbour (id: 132316)

Throughout the Bible, neighbour is a way of talking about other people. People from Jacob’s family line understood that all other Israelites were their neighbours. They treated them better than they treated outsiders. (Outsider) In the New Testament, Jesus taught that all human beings are neighbours to one another. All people are to be treated with love and respect.
