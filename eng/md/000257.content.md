## Human beings (id: 132148)

God created human beings in his likeness. He meant for them to live for ever in complete peace with him. They were to live in peace with one another and with the rest of creation. But Adam and Eve sinned. Since then sin and death have had control over human beings. Human beings sin. Human beings die.
