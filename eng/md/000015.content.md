## Abel (id: 132167)

The second son of Adam and Eve. He was a shepherd. He made an offering that pleased God. His brother Cain killed him even though he hadn’t done anything wrong. The Bible talks about Abel’s blood crying out to God from the ground. This meant that God needed to bring justice because Abel was murdered.
