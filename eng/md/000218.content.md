## God’s people (id: 132248)

A way to talk about the nation of Israel. After Jesus came, anyone who follows him is considered part of God’s people. Every human being is invited to follow Jesus. This is true no matter what family, group or nation people come from. It’s true no matter what language they speak. Worshipping Jesus brings them together as one in God’s family. (Israel)
