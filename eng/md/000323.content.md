## Levites (id: 132289)

People from the family line of Jacob’s son Levi. All males in Levi’s tribe had special work to do. They took care of the holy tent and later the temple. Levites from Aaron’s family line served as priests (Aaron, Priest). The Levites didn’t receive land when the nation of Israel started living in Canaan. God provided for them from what the other tribes had.
