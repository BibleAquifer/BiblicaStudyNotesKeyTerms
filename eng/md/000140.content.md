## Death and Hell (id: 132136)

In Revelation, John described death and hell as evil powers that God judged. This means that God stopped death and hell for ever. Because of this, people in God’s kingdom on earth will never die. And people who refuse to join God’s kingdom will be separated from God for ever.
