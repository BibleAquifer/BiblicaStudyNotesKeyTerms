## Sea (id: 132018)

Many stories in the Bible describe the sea as something to be feared. It was something people needed God to save them from. This included the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. It included Jonah when he was tossed into the sea. It included Jesus when he calmed the storm on the sea. It included Johnâ€™s vision in Revelation of the beast who came from the sea.
