## Servants (id: 132324)

Israelites were allowed to work as servants for other Israelites. This was to help them pay off debts they owed. After six years of working, they were given the choice to be set free. If they chose to be set free they were given food and livestock. The servant could also choose to continue working for the same family their entire life. Servants werenâ€™t to be treated badly or considered slaves. This was because God had freed them from slavery in Egypt. They were never to be slaves again. Being slaves again was one of the covenant curses.
