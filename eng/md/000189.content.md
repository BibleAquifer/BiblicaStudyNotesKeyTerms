## Feast of Booths (id: 132323)

The Jewish feast that started five days after the day when sins were paid for. The people celebrated the harvest and how God provided for them. Israelite males were required to travel to the holy tent or temple for this feast. During the seven days of the feast, they slept in booths. This was to remember how they had lived in booths or tents in the desert. Every seven years the covenant law was to be read out loud during this feast.
