## Samson (id: 132385)

One of the 12 judges of Israel. He was from the tribe of Dan and his father was Manoah. The angel of the Lord appeared to his mother to announce his birth. He was to live as a Nazirite his entire life. God used Samson to free the Israelites from being treated badly by the Philistines.
