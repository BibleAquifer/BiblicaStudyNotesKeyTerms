## Name (id: 132171)

In the times and places of the Bible, names were very important. They meant more than a way to talk about someone. They were a way to show who the person was and what they were like. This was understood to be true about God as well. Saying anything about God’s name was a way of saying something about God himself. Trusting in God’s name was the same as trusting in God.
