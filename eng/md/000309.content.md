## King (id: 132276)

The ruler with the highest authority among certain people groups. God was to be the King of the Israelites. Human kings in Israel were supposed to lead the people the way God led them. This was very different from how kings of other people groups led. Israelite kings were to study God’s laws and obey them. They were to help the people stay faithful to God’s covenant. Israelite kings were to protect people who were weak and needy. They shouldn’t have many wives or become very rich. They were to be humble. They shouldn’t treat their people as slaves. They shouldn’t trust in weapons and horses for winning battles. Israelite kings were to trust in God and serve him only.
