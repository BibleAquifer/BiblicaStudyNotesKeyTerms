A way of talking about all the spiritual beings that exist. It isn’t a certain place. The heavenly world includes spiritual beings that serve God and it includes evil spiritual beings. (Spiritual beings, Evil spiritual beings). The heavenly world is also known as the spiritual realm. Human beings can’t see, hear or touch the heavenly world on their own. The choices they make have an effect in the heavenly world. This includes their choices about who to worship and how to treat others. The prayers of Jesus’ followers also have an effect in the heavenly world. When God shows humans beings things in the heavenly world it’s called a vision.
