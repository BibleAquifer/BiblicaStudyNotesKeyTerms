## Holy living (id: 131990)

Following Jesus’ example for how to think, speak and act. This is how believers can be holy like God is holy. There are many reasons why God wants his people to live holy lives. One reason is that the Holy Spirit lives among them and in them. Another reason is that holy living helps the members of God’s family treat each other well. It helps them to always show care and love towards one another. Holy living shows that believers have been set free from the power of sin and death. This helps them spread the message about Jesus among unbelievers. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for believers to live in holy ways. Holy living is also called a godly life.
