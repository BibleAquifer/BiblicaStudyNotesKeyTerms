## I am (id: 132250)

The name that God used to describe himself to Moses in Exodus 3:14\. The name is made up of the Hebrew letters YHWH. No one knows exactly what this name means. The letters YHWH sound like the Hebrew words for I am who I am. God is who he is and he chooses what he does. No one and nothing make God be or do anything. Jesus used these same words to describe who he is in the book of John.
