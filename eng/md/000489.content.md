## Son of David (id: 131998)

A name used for Jesus to show that he was Israel’s true King and Messiah. God had promised King David that his kingdom would last for ever. This would happen because someone from his family line would be the messiah. Jesus was the promised ruler from David’s family. (David 1 Samuel 16:1 – 17:58\.)
