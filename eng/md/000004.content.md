## 144,000 (id: 132130)

This number was 12 x 12,000\. It was a way to talk about the entire people of God. They were from all times and places and there were too many to count. It didn’t mean exactly 144,000 people from Abraham’s family line. It meant the complete number of those who trust in Jesus.
