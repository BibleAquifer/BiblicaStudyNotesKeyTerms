## Most Holy Room (id: 132311)

The room where the ark of the covenant was kept (ark of the covenant). This room was first in the holy tent and later in the temple. God was present among the Israelites there. A thick curtain separated it from the rest of the tent or temple. The curtain was a sign of how human beings were separated from God. If people walked behind the curtain they would die. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Room. He did this once a year. When Jesus died, the curtain to the Most Holy Room ripped open. That was a sign that Jesus’ death brought people close to God again.
