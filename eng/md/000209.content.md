## Gifts of the Spirit (id: 132095)

The Holy Spirit gives people the ability to do certain things well. These gifts arenâ€™t something that people can hold in their hands. They are spiritual gifts. Some gifts are teaching, taking care of others and healing those who are ill. Followers of Jesus use their gifts to encourage and strengthen the church.
