## Speak other languages (id: 132043)

When people speak out loud in a language they didn’t know before. The Holy Spirit has given some believers the ability to do this. Others listening to them may or may not speak the language. Unless someone can explain the message, believers with this gift should speak only with God. Doing this will help them be close to God through prayer. (Explain other languages)
