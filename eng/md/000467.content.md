## Seal (id: 132468)

There are several meanings for the word seal in the Bible. The first meaning is to close something up or shut it. The second is to put into effect an agreement or covenant. The third meaning is a piece of sticky wax. People would put the wax on important scrolls or papers to close them. Only people with permission were supposed to break the seal and open the papers. The last meaning is an official or royal mark that shows who someone is. A seal that was pressed onto papers or other things left its mark on them. This showed that the person agreed to something or that it belonged to them.
