This is three and a half years. It’s half of seven years. In the Bible, seven is the number for things being complete. In Revelation, John saw certain things happen for half of seven years. This meant that those things weren’t complete. It meant that the powerful ruler or government in Revelation chapter 13 wouldn’t have total power. Their power wouldn’t last for ever like God’s kingdom would.
