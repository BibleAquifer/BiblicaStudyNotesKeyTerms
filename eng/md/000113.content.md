## Cloud of witnesses (id: 132112)

A way of describing people who believe in God and serve him before they die. They are witnesses to who God is while they are alive on earth. A cloud is a way to describe them together as a group. These people have died. Their examples of faith in God encourage believers who are alive. Their spirits wait for when God will raise his people from the dead. The people mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11 are among these witnesses.
