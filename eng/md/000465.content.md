## Saviour (id: 132265)

God saved the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. He saved them from their enemies many times throughout the Old Testament. He was the only one powerful enough to save them. In these ways he showed himself to be their only Saviour. He also promised to send a Saviour who would live among them. This was Jesus the Messiah. Jesus saves those who believe in him and follow him. He saves them from the power of sin, death and evil.
