## Sabbath day (id: 132159)

The seventh day of the week for Israelites and Jews. It was a holy day when they rested and didn’t work. This included their livestock, their servants and outsiders who lived with them. It was a day to honour how God rested after creating the world. It also honoured the rest God promised the Israelites after freeing them from slavery in Egypt. The Sabbath day was a sign of God’s covenant with the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The day was a reminder that God is good and provides what his people need. Later, Jewish religious leaders made many rules about what was allowed on the Sabbath day. These rules didn’t always help people honour God. Jesus taught people how to honour God on the Sabbath day. Even though the leaders opposed him, he performed miracles on the Sabbath day.
