## Burnt offerings (id: 132296)

Sacrifices or offerings of clean male animals or birds that people chose to make. The entire animal except for the skin was burnt. This was a sign that the person making the sacrifice was completely committed to God. There were certain times that burnt offerings had to be made. People could also make burnt offerings other times when they wanted to. Trumpets were blown during burnt offerings.
