## High priest (id: 132314)

The religious leader with the most authority in Israel. The high priest was to be a male from the tribe of Levi. He was to be from Aaron’s family line. The high priest was to teach the people like Moses had done. He had special duties in God’s holy tent and later in the temple. Only the high priest was allowed into the Most Holy Room. He told the people what God wanted them to do. He also made the sacrifices for Israel’s sin to be forgiven.
