## Nebuchadnezzar (id: 132447)

A king of Babylon from the Chaldean people group. God used him as a tool to bring judgement against the southern kingdom. In the year 586 BC his armies destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. The prophet Daniel explained some of Nebuchadnezzarâ€™s dreams to him. Nebuchadnezzar worshipped false gods but recognised that the God of the Jews had authority.
