## Nebuchadnezzar (id: 132447)

A king of Babylon from the Chaldean people group. God used him as a tool to bring judgement against the southern kingdom. In the year 586 BC his armies destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. The prophet Daniel explained some of Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams to him. Nebuchadnezzar worshipped false gods but recognised that the God of the Jews had authority.
