## Sanhedrin (id: 132013)

A group of 70 religious leaders. They had the most authority in Jewish courts in Jesusâ€™ time. The Sanhedrin was also called the Jewish Council. They looked after the temple in Jerusalem and made important decisions for the Jewish people. Both Pharisees and Sadducees served in the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin opposed Jesus. They also opposed the apostles who spread the news about Jesus being raised from the dead.
