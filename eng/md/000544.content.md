## World (id: 132161)

Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word world. The first meaning is the place God created for plants, animals and humans to live. The second meaning is a way of talking about evil. The world that God created is good and not evil. Yet the devil is evil and he has power to do evil things in the world. Many people choose to follow his evil ways. This is what New Testament writers meant when they wrote about the ways of the world. They also wrote that Jesus won the battle over the world. This means that Jesus has victory over sin, death and all evil spiritual beings. Jesus won this battle by suffering, dying on the cross and being raised from the dead. Because of this, Jesus’ followers live under the power of the Holy Spirit. They don’t live as slaves to the power of sin, death and evil. That is what New Testament writers meant about being set free from this evil world.
