## Book of life (id: 132290)

Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the book of life. It’s also called God’s book. In the Old Testament, it was a way of talking about people who are alive. It was described as a list of names collected in a book that God writes. In the New Testament, it was a way of talking about people who follow Jesus. It was described as belonging to the Lamb of God. The book of life isn’t an actual book with names written in it. It’s a way of talking about who is alive or who believes in Jesus.
