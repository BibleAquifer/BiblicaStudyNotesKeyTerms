## Garden of Eden (id: 132153)

The garden that God made when he created the world. The first human beings lived and worked there. Life in the Garden of Eden was how God wanted his world to be. God and humans lived together in peace. The garden was beautiful and had many kinds of plants and animals. The plants were healthy to eat and there was plenty of water. Humans didnâ€™t need to protect themselves from anything in the garden.
