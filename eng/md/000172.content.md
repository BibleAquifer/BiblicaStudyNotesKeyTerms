## Eternal life (id: 132515)

Life that can’t be destroyed by sin or death. It will last for ever. Jesus was the first human being to have eternal life. It’s the life he had when God raised him from the dead. Jesus gives it to all who believe in him and follow him. They will have eternal life in the new creation. It’s a life of peace and friendship with God.
