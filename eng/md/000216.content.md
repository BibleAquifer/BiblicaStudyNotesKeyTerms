## God’s anger (id: 132446)

The Bible describes God as angry at sin and evil. He shows his anger by bringing judgement against those who refuse to stop doing evil. He brings judgement against those who refuse to repent and turn away from sin. Writers in the Bible described God’s anger like a winepress. In a winepress, grapes are crushed to make wine. Writers in the Bible also described God’s anger like a cup of wine. Those who refused to stop sinning and doing evil deeds had to drink it. These were pictures of God’s judgement. They were pictures of how God stops those who do evil and punishes them. People who believe in Jesus are set free from the power of sin and evil. Because of this, they are saved from God’s anger against sin and evil. In Revelation, God’s anger and the Lamb’s anger are the same thing.
