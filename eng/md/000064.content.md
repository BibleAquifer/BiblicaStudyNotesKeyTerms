## Athens (id: 132076)

A very important Greek city in the Roman territory of Achaia. Paul visited it on his second journey. He shared the message of Jesus with the thinkers and leaders at the Areopagus. The Areopagus was a hill outside of Athens. There a council of Athenian leaders would meet and talk about important matters.
