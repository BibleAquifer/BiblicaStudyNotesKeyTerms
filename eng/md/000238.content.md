## Heaven (id: 132147)

Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word heaven. The first meaning is the sky above the earth. The second meaning is where God the King and Creator rules. It isn’t a certain place that can be travelled to. It’s where God is worshipped. God will bring heaven to earth in the new creation. People can’t fully understand or imagine heaven. (Kingdom of God, New creation)
