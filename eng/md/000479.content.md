## Sihon and Og (id: 132341)

Two Amorite kings who lived east of the River Jordan. Sihon was the king of Heshbon and Og was the king of Bashan. The Israelites asked for permission to travel through their lands in peace. Sihon and Og attacked them but the Israelites won the battles. Some of the Israelite tribes chose to remain and live in those lands.
