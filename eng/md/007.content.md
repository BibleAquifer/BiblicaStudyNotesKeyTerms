## Faith (id: 132178)

There are several meanings for faith in the Bible. The first meaning is the things people believe about God. God wants all people to believe what is true about him. These are things that God has shown about himself and ways that he has acted. In the New Testament, these things include the message of the good news about Jesus. The second meaning of faith is the belief itself. This is the trust that people have in God. It’s based on their hope of how God will keep his promises. How strong people’s faith is shows how much they trust God. Their faith grows as they know God more and more. The third meaning of faith is how people live based on what they believe.

## Forgive (id: 132227)

Several words from the Hebrew and Greek languages are used in the Bible for the word forgive. These words describe in many ways what it means to forgive and to be forgiven. A debt of money can be forgiven. This means that the person who owes money no longer must pay it back. Sin can be forgiven. God is the one who forgives sin. This means that God recognises what sin has been committed. God recognises which person or group of people is guilty of that sin. Guilt is like a heavy weight that God lifts off someone when he forgives. God removes the guilt of the person or group. It’s like God takes the sin and releases it somewhere far away. God chooses to not bring judgement against the person or group because of their sin. God is always ready to forgive people for their sin. This is because he is full of mercy and love. God wants all people and all groups of people to turn away from sin. He wants them to ask him to forgive them. God also wants all people and all groups of people to follow his example. He wants them to forgive one another for their sins.
