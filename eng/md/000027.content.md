## AD 70 (id: 132007)

The year that Roman armies destroyed the temple. They also destroyed much of the city of Jerusalem. Jewish rebels had been fighting against Romeâ€™s rule for four years. Then Roman armies killed many Jews and burnt the temple down. It was never rebuilt. Jesus had warned people many times that this would happen. Jesus described it as punishment for not accepting him as the Messiah sent by God.
