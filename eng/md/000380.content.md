## Needy people (id: 132364)

In the Old Testament, people who were needy were those who didn’t have land to farm. Without land, they couldn’t grow food or have livestock. Outsiders and widows were needy people. So were children whose fathers had died. People were also needy if they had land but didn’t have success in farming. In the New Testament, anyone who was poor or needed help was considered needy.
