## Super-apostle (id: 132099)

What Paul called certain Jewish leaders. These leaders opposed his work in the churches he helped start. Compared to Paul, they seemed strong, successful, healthy and rich. They told lies about Paul and claimed that he was always causing trouble. They took advantage of new believers and didnâ€™t serve people with love. They pretended to serve God but were really serving Satan by doing evil.
