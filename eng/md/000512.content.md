## Tamar - David (id: 132417)

The daughter of David and Makaah. She and Absalom had the same parents. She and Amnon had the same father. Amnon raped Tamar when she was a virgin. Then he threw her out of his house. In those days, this was the same as divorcing her. Being raped and then not married brought shame to Tamar in their community. It meant she probably wouldn’t get married or have a family of her own. She lived with Absalom after that happened.
