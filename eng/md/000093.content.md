## Born again (id: 132035)

A way of describing what happens when people believe in Jesus as King and Saviour. They stop living as slaves to sin. Being a slave to sin is like being dead spiritually even though the body is alive. When people trust Jesus, he gives their spirit new life. This new birth is a spiritual birth. It’s not the same as someone’s body being born. New life for their bodies will come later when God raises people from the dead.
