## Zelophehad’s daughters (id: 132351)

Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah were from the tribe of Manasseh. Their father Zelophehad died in the desert after the Israelites refused to enter Canaan. His daughters received land for Zelophehad’s family line since he had no sons. They married cousins in their family group. This way their land would always belong to the tribe of Manasseh.
