## Incense (id: 132317)

Something that is burnt to make smoke that smells good. Many people groups throughout history have used incense in their worship practices. God gave instructions to priests in Israel about how to burn it. They used shallow cups to burn it on an altar. It was an offering to honour God. The incense smelled sweet and this reminded Godâ€™s people that God gave them good things. Smoke from incense was also a sign of prayers being prayed to God.
