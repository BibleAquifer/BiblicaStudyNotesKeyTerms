## High places (id: 132445)

A place of worship on a hill, mountain or place of high ground. People burnt incense and made sacrifices there. Some high places were used for worshipping the true God. This happened often before the temple was built. Other high places were used for worshipping false gods. People would even sacrifice children on them to honour false gods. There were many of these high places when the Israelites first entered Canaan. The Israelites were supposed to destroy all high places used to worship false gods.
