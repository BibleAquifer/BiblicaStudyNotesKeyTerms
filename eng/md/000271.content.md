## James (id: 132065)

One of Jesus’ brothers. At first he didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah. After Jesus was raised from the dead, he appeared to James. James trusted Jesus and became a leader in the church in Jerusalem. The New Testament includes one letter that he wrote. This is a different James to James the apostle.
