## Glory (id: 132294)

The wonderful beauty, majesty, goodness and presence of God. It’s a way of talking about who God is and how pure and holy he is. Only the Creator has this glory. He chooses to share it with those he has created. Created beings show God’s glory when they carry out his plans for his creation.
