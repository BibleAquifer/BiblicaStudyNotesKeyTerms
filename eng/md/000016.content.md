## Abiathar (id: 132405)

The son of Ahimelek who served as high priest when David was king. He was from Eli’s family line. He was faithful to David but didn’t support Solomon as the king after David. Because of this he was no longer allowed to be the high priest. This fulfilled the prophecy against Eli’s family line.
