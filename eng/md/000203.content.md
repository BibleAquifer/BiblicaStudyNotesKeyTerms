## Galilee (id: 131982)

The northern area of the land God had promised to give Abraham’s family line. It included land that had been part of the northern kingdom of Israel. It was ruled by Herod Antipas in Jesus’ time. Jesus grew up in Galilee. The Sea of Galilee was a large lake in that area. The River Jordan flows south from it. Many stories from Jesus’ life happened in Galilee and around the Sea of Galilee.
