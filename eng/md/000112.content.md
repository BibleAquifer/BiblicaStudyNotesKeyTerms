## Cloud (id: 132267)

God often made his presence known to people through a cloud. That is how he showed his glory to them. In the Old Testament this happened in the pillar of cloud after the Israelites left Egypt. It happened on Mount Sinai, over the holy tent and over the ark of the covenant. It happened in the Holy Room of the temple and in Ezekiel’s vision of the temple. In the New Testament it happened with Jesus, Peter, James and John on the mountain. It happened when Jesus returned to his Father and in John’s vision of the Son of Man. It will happen again when Jesus returns to earth.
