## Pentecost (id: 132321)

The Jewish feast 50 days after the feast of the first share of crops. It was called the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost. People offered sacrifices to God and thanked him for the harvest. Israelite males were required to travel to the holy tent or temple for this feast. It’s also the feast when the Holy Spirit first came to Jesus’ followers. This happened 50 days after Jesus’ resurrection.
