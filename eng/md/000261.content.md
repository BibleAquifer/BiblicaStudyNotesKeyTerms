## Immanuel (id: 132484)

A name in the Hebrew language that means God is with us. In the time of King Ahaz, Isaiah prophesied about a boy named Immanuel. He would be a sign that God was with the southern kingdom. This child was a sign that the southern kingdom would be saved. They would be saved from enemy armies that attacked them. Isaiah’s prophecy also had a meaning for the future. Matthew wrote about this in his gospel. Through Jesus, God was with his people in a human body. Jesus is the Immanuel who saves God’s people from the enemies of sin and death.
