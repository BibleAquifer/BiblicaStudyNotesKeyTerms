## Proverb (id: 132477)

A short and wise saying. Proverbs come to exist when a person or a community studies life in the world. As they study, they learn lessons and notice patterns. These patterns are about how life in the world works. The person or community puts these lessons and patterns into words like a short poem. Proverbs are passed down within families and communities for hundreds of years. A proverb isnâ€™t a promise that life always works according to the pattern it describes.
