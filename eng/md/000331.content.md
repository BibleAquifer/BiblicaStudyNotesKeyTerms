The meal that Christians share together to remember Jesus’ death. It’s based on the last supper that Jesus shared with his disciples before he died. It’s also based on the Jewish Passover Feast. The meal includes eating bread and drinking wine. These remind believers that Jesus gave his body and his blood to save all people.
