## Second death (id: 132121)

A way of describing God’s final judgement against those who refuse to follow him. They are destroyed and are separated from God for ever. John described the place where the second death took place as a lake of fire. It was also called a lake of burning sulphur. Those who were thrown into it would have no part in God’s kingdom on earth.
