## Salvation (id: 132142)

When God comes and rescues his people. Over hundreds of years God slowly showed his plan for salvation. The Israelites and Jews had been waiting for God to save them. They waited for him to save them once and for all from their enemies. They thought that their enemies were human armies or people who treated them badly. But God is committed to saving all that he created. He will save it from the power of sin, death and evil. This includes all people who trust in him. This became clear when Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead. When people believe in Jesus, he rescues them from the power of sin, death and evil. This is the beginning of their salvation. Everyone who believes in Jesus is saved for ever. Salvation will be complete when Jesus returns to earth. (Believe in)
