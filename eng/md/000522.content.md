## Test (id: 132209)

Times when people must make a difficult choice. They must choose between obeying God or doing what they want to do. The choice they make shows if they trust God to provide what they need. The purpose behind the test isn’t to cause people to make mistakes or for them to suffer. The purpose is for them to receive more of God’s grace. God tests people to help their faith in him grow stronger.
