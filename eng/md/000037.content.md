## Altar (id: 132231)

Something people built to honour God. They worshipped by making sacrifices on the altar. People often built altars to recognise a special way that God had spoken or acted. Altars helped them remember what God had said or done. The altars also showed that people were committed to worshipping and obeying God. God gave careful instructions about building the altars in the holy tent and the temple. People also built altars to worship false gods.
