## Spiritual fight (id: 132512)

The battle of the devil and all evil spiritual beings against God. They want to stop Godâ€™s plan for the world. One way they do this is by trying to make people turn against God. The fight occurs in the heavenly world. Humans are part of the fight through the choices they make. They make choices about who to worship and how to treat others. Worshipping God and acting according to his plan is how they fight against evil.
