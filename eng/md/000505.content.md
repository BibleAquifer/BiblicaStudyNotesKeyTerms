## Stories (id: 132144)

It was very important to the Israelites to remember stories and teachings. They told the stories of what happened among their people from long ago. They told the stories about Godâ€™s mighty works. They also told the stories about the laws and teachings they had received from God. Older people told these things to younger people. In this way everyone learnt the stories and teachings that were important to the community.
