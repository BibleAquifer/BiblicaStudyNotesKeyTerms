## Darkness (id: 131985)

Throughout the Bible there are two meanings for the word darkness. The first meaning is when the sun sets and it’s dark outside. The second meaning is a sign of things that are opposed to God. This darkness causes confusion and problems. It wants to destroy what God has made. Evil and evil spiritual beings are talked about as the kingdom of darkness. (Evil spiritual beings)
