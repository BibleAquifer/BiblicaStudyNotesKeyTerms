## Rehoboam (id: 132424)

The son of Solomon and an Ammonite woman named Naamah. While Rehoboam was king, the nation of Israel divided into two kingdoms. Rehoboam ruled over the southern kingdom of Judah. He was a foolish leader who did evil things and worshipped false gods. He didnâ€™t have the wealth or power that Solomon had.
