## Zechariah - NT (id: 132026)

The father of John the Baptist. Elizabeth was his wife. He was a priest from the tribe of Levi and from Aaron’s family line. Zechariah spoke a beautiful prophecy when John the Baptist was born.


## Zelophehad’s daughters (id: 132351)

Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah were from the tribe of Manasseh. Their father Zelophehad died in the desert after the Israelites refused to enter Canaan.
