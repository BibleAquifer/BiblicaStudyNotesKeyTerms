## Manna (id: 132269)

The bread from heaven that God provided for the Israelites in the desert after the exodus. God sent it to them six days a week. It was the food the Israelites ate until they entered Canaan. A jar full of manna was kept in the ark of the covenant. This was a reminder to the people of how God had provided for them.
