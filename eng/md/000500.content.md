## Spiritual blessings (id: 132101)

Ways that God blesses his people spiritually. These blessings aren’t something that people can hold in their hands. They are the riches in heaven that Jesus talked about (Matthew 6:19–21\). There are many kinds of spiritual blessings. Wisdom, understanding, grace, hope and love are spiritual blessings. Being forgiven for sin and having eternal life are also spiritual blessings. People don’t earn spiritual blessings. God gives them freely.
