## False gods (id: 132230)

Anything that people worship that is more important to them than the true God. People worship things because they believe they have power. The devil uses their worship of these things to trap people and control them. The people groups in the Bible made pictures or statues of some of these things. Pictures or statues of false gods are objects that have no power.
