## Tent of meeting (id: 132293)

A tent outside the Israelite camp near Mount Sinai. God met with Moses and the Israelites there through the pillar of cloud. Certain women served at the entrance and Joshua stayed in the tent all the time. After the holy tent was built the tent of meeting was no longer used. But the holy tent was also called the tent of meeting.
