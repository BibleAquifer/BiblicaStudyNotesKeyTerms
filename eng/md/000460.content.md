An Israelite who served Godâ€™s people as a prophet, a priest and a judge. In the Hebrew language the name Samuel means to be heard by God. The name can also mean borrowed from God.

Samuel was raised as a Nazirite in the holy tent at Shiloh. He started serving the Israelites as a prophet when he was young. He served as a priest after Eli died.
