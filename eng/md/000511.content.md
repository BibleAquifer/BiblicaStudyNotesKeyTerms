The daughter\-in\-law of Judah. Her first two husbands were Judah’s sons but they both died. After that, Judah slept with Tamar without knowing who she was. She got pregnant and had twin sons. Jesus is from the family line of Tamar’s son Perez. This is a different Tamar than the daughter of King David.
