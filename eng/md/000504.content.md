## Stone tablets (id: 132285)

Pieces of stone that Moses carved out of rock. God wrote on them the words of the Ten Commandments and the covenant law. They were the written copy of the covenant agreement between God and the Israelites. Moses broke the first set of tablets. He broke them when the Israelites worshipped the metal statue of the calf. Later God wrote the covenant agreement on two new tablets. These were kept in the ark of the covenant.
