## Naaman (id: 132434)

An important commander of Aram’s army. A young Israelite girl was a servant in his house. He followed her advice to ask Elisha to heal him of his skin disease. At first Naaman refused to follow Elisha’s instructions. But when he made himself humble and obeyed, he was healed. Then he believed in God. He worshipped only God when he returned to Aram.
